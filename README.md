# Fake Instagram Profile Identification and Classification Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on identifying and classifying fake Instagram profiles using machine learning techniques. The goal is to enhance online safety, user trust, and platform integrity by automating the detection of fake profiles. The system analyzes Instagram profiles and their associated content, employing machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) to classify profiles as either genuine or fake.

Key Features:
Machine Learning Algorithms: Implements SVM, RF, and DT for profile classification.

User Interface: Provides an easy-to-use GUI for profile analysis and manual verification.

Performance Metrics: Displays accuracy metrics such as precision, recall, and F-score for each algorithm.

Secure User Management: Includes login and registration features to ensure authorized access.

This project contributes to building a safer online environment and enhances social media platform integrity by automating the identification of fake accounts.
